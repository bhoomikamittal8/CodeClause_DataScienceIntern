# CodeClause - DataScience Internship

This repository contains two separate projects:

### Stock Price Prediction

The Stock Price Prediction project uses historical stock market data and machine learning techniques to predict future stock prices. It employs time series analysis and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to forecast stock prices based on historical trends and patterns.

### Medicine Recommending System

The Medicine Recommending System leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to recommend medicines based on textual descriptions. It calculates medicine similarities using cosine similarity and assists users in finding alternative medicines based on their descriptions.

## Project Details

### Stock Price Prediction

- **Usage**: Run the provided Jupyter Notebook `stock_price_prediction.ipynb` to analyze historical stock data, train the LSTM model, and predict future stock prices.

### Medicine Recommending System

- **Usage**: Open the Jupyter Notebook `medicine_recommendation.ipynb`, preprocess data, calculate medicine similarities using NLP techniques, and get medicine recommendations based on user input.

## Usage Notes

- Each project directory contains detailed instructions and explanations within their respective Jupyter Notebooks (`stock_price_prediction.ipynb` and `medicine_recommendation.ipynb`).
- Adjust parameters, explore different datasets, or modify algorithms as needed to fit specific use cases or data requirements.
- Refer to individual project READMEs and notebooks for additional setup instructions, dependencies, and usage guidelines.
