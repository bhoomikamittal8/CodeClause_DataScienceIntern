## Introduction

This project aims to analyze historical stock price data of Tesla (TSLA) and build a predictive model using linear regression. The data is sourced from a CSV file (`TSLA.csv`) containing daily stock prices including Open, High, Low, Close, and Adjusted Close.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- Scikit-learn

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bhoomikamittal8/CodeClause_DataScienceIntern/tree/main/Stock_Market_Prediction
   cd Stock_Market_Prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Ensure `TSLA.csv` is in the project directory.
   - Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to load and preprocess the data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze basic statistics of the data.
   - Visualize stock prices using Matplotlib and Plotly.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Scale features if necessary (noted but not implemented in current code).

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Train a linear regression model.
   - Evaluate the model using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

5. **Visualization:**
   - Plot actual vs. predicted stock prices using Plotly.

6. **Interpretation:**
   - Examine scores and metrics to assess the model's performance.

## File Descriptions

- **`TSLA.csv`**: Contains historical stock price data for Tesla.
- **`Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis, visualization, model building, and evaluation.
